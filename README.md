## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
p value and ground clearance

- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
No, the pvalue.

- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
This model can predict 71.49% effectively, which is ok but not ideal. There are determinates that can affect the mpg of Mechar Prototypes. 

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
- The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not
The variance is below 100 for the total, therefore it meets criteria. Looking at each lot individually no, for lot 3 exceeds 100 pounds per square inch. 

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils
Lot 1 and lot 2 have normal distributions but when you look at lot 3 it is not, the variance exceeds and the pvalue is lower than 0.5. Therefore, lot 3 differs and is not normally distributed.
